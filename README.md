# Setup

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and create an access token with the following permissions. Save the Bot User OAuth Access Token somewhere as it is needed for the Cloud Function.

- chat:write.public
- channels:join
- chat:write
- chat:write.customize

2. Create a new Cloud Pub/Sub topic called ***billing-alerts***. This will topic will be used for the billing alert publisher.

3. Navigate to Billing in the Google Cloud Console and create your budget. When creating your budget, modify "Manage notifications" to configure the Cloud Pub/Sub topic ***billing-alerts*** that was created in the previous stepÂ¹.

4. Navigate to Cloud Functions in the Google Cloud Console and create a new cloud function with the following values:

- Name: slack-billing-notification
- Trigger: Cloud Pub/Sub
- Topic: billing-alerts
- Source code: inline editor
- Runtime: Node.js 10
- Function to execute: notifySlack

5. Configure two Runtime variables:

- SLACK_CHANNEL: The name of the slack channel where the notifications should be sent to.
- BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN: The Bot Token that was created in  the first step.

6. Click deploy.

# Testing

It is requried to encode the Pub/Sub test data as Base64. The snippet below is some plain JSON data that would be similar to the actual data.
```
{
 "costAmount": 501,
 "budgetAmount": 1000,
 "budgetDisplayName": "test",
 "alertThresholdExceeded": 0.50
}
```

We need to take that plain JSON and convert it Base64 format. You can do this by going to https://www.browserling.com/tools/json-to-base64. The result is this.
```
ewogImNvc3RBbW91bnQiOiA1MDEsCiAiYnVkZ2V0QW1vdW50IjogMTAwMCwKICJidWRnZXREaXNwbGF5TmFtZSI6ICJ0ZXN0IiwKICJhbGVydFRocmVzaG9sZEV4Y2VlZGVkIjogMC41MAp9
```

Finally we put that output into the following JSON. Use this message as the test input for the Cloud Function.
```
{
 "data": "ewogImNvc3RBbW91bnQiOiA1MDEsCiAiYnVkZ2V0QW1vdW50IjogMTAwMCwKICJidWRnZXREaXNwbGF5TmFtZSI6ICJ0ZXN0IiwKICJhbGVydFRocmVzaG9sZEV4Y2VlZGVkIjogMC41MAp9",
 "attributes": {
       "budgetId": "test"
 }
}
```

And that is all, you should see a notification when you run the test.
